> ‚ùóÔ∏è **Only for those who purchased a Founder's Pack before June 29, 2020**

## Motivation ‚ö°
> I originally wanted to make a simple bot for daily rewards with notification, but this feature was removed from the game. I got desperate and did nothing, in July i asked to make a replace quest feature from [PRO100KatYT](https://github.com/PRO100KatYT/SaveTheWorldClaimer) and he inspired me. I'm too lazy to open the game every time to get a new quest or replace it,
so I created this bot to do it at any time.<br><br>p.s. *python is my hobby since 2012, I rarely write anything and I'm not sure about the quality of the code. This is my first github project, welcome any bug fixes! :)*

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

* Auto receipt of a daily quest.
* Quest replace via buttons.
* Rough quest completion time.
* Auth with epic games link to auth-code.
* Auto refresh Fortnite API tokens.
* Filter: first user can use bot / all.
* UX only in 2 message (hi/quest).
* Autodetect telegram user language (compare with FN langs).
* Change quest language (all 15 langs from Fortnite).
* Delete all telegram trash messages.
* Server load info, user bot stats.
* Use .json file for "database".
